** cursor
**
** This module defines the Cursor abstraction, which is used to iterate over rows in a table.
** Cursors provide a consistent way to traverse rows during execution of queries like SELECT and INSERT.
** 
**  A Cursor is a pointer-like structure that keeps track of where you are in the table. It holds:
**  - The current row number
**  - A reference to the table
**  - A flag for whether youâ€™re at the end of the table
**
** Functions:
** - table_start(): Returns a cursor pointing to the beginning of the table.
** - table_end():   Returns a cursor pointing just past the last row (used to signal the end of iteration).
**
** Usage:
**   Cursors simplify row navigation logic, especially when more advanced features like paging or B-trees are added later.
**   This makes your database engine modular, extensible, and easier to maintain.
